Create a folder terra-provisoner and cd into it.
here create a file main.tf  and define resource here like instance, security_gruop, key_pair
define remote provisoner with command to install apache on it
and define a connection for provisioner

using remote exec provisioner cd into /var/www/html folder and create index.html file  with some text

So this lab is about creating an Ec2 instance on aws 
installing apache server on it using terraform provisioner.
